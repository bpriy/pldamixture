\title{Summarize \code{fit_mixture()} object}
\usage{
\method{summary}{fitmixture}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The result of a call to \code{fit_mixture()}}

\item{...}{for additional summary arguments}
}
\value{
A list of results from the function called depending on the "family" specified.
\item{call}{the matched call}
\item{family}{assumed type of (outcome) regression model}
\item{coefficients}{a matrix with the outcome model's coefficient estimates for the "cox" family. For other families,
it is a matrix with the outcome model's coefficient estimates, standard errors, t or z values, and p-values}
\item{m.coefficients}{a matrix with the correct match model's coefficient estimates. For all families
except "cox", the matrix also includes standard errors}
\item{avgcmr}{average correct match rate among all records}
\item{match.prob}{correct match probabilities for all observations}
\item{dispersion}{the dispersion parameter estimate when the family is a Generalized
Linear Model}
}
\description{
Summarize results from the adjustment approach

## commonness score of first and last names used for linkage
mformula <- ~commf + comml
## hand-linked records are considered "safe" matches

## overall mismatch rate in the data set is assumed to be ~ 0.05
