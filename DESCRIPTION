Description: A package for inference in the secondary analysis setting with linked
  data potentially containing mismatch errors. Only the linked data file may be 
  accessible and information about the record linkage process may be limited 
  or unavailable. Implements the 'General Framework for Regression with Mismatched 
  Data' developed by Slawski et al., 2023. The framework uses a mixture model for
  pairs of linked records whose two components reflect distributions conditional
  on match status, i.e., correct match or mismatch. Inference is based on composite 
  likelihood and the EM algorithm. The package currently supports CoxPH Regression 
  (right-censored data only) and Generalized Linear Regression Models (Gaussian, 
  Gamma, Poisson, and Logistic (binary models only)). Information about the 
  underlying record linkage process can be incorporated into the method if 
  available (e.g., assumed overall mismatch rate, safe matches, or predictors of
  match status).
